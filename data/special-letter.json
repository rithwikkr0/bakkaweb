  "letter": "Bakka… I read your letter again and again. Every line you wrote touched me deeply. I never knew someone could care for me the way you do… and after reading your words, I understood how real and pure your heart is.\n\nYou said I am important to you… but Bakka, you are just as important to me — maybe even more. You said you will stay with me no matter what… and I want you to know that I will also stay with you… always.\n\nI know sometimes I hurt you without meaning to. Sometimes I didn't understand your feelings properly. But your letter opened my eyes… it showed me how much you love, how much you feel, and how strong your heart actually is.\n\nThank you for trusting me. Thank you for sharing your feelings with me. Thank you for making me feel special in a way no one ever has.\n\nYou told me to share everything with you… and I promise I will. I won't hide my feelings anymore. If I'm sad, I'll tell you. If something hurts me, I'll tell you. If I feel alone, I'll come to you. Just like how you want to be there for me… I also want to be there for you, Bakka.\n\nIf your heart is heavy, I'm here. If you're scared, I'm here. If you're angry, I'm here. If you want to cry, I'm here. If you're happy, I want to smile with you. And if life breaks you, I'll be the one holding you together.\n\nYou are not too much. You are not difficult. Your feelings are not wrong. Your love is not wrong. You are real. And that's why I value you more than you know.\n\nYou said you won't leave me no matter what… and I want you to know that I won't leave you either. Not now, not later, not ever.\n\nThank you for writing that letter to me, Bakka. This is my reply — from my heart directly to yours.\n\nAlways with you,\nYour Chintu ❤️"
